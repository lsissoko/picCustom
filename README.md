=========

Python script that allows you to quickly copy and rename a large set of images. The values assigned to the 'newString', 'delim', 'count', 'pad', 'typeIn', and 'typeOut' settings variables will determine the new images' prefix, of the form (newString + delim + count + typeOut).

I wrote this with concert and event pictures in mind but it would work for other filetypes.
